SYNTACTIC ANNOTATIONS:

In sentences consisting of up to 42 words, noun and prepositional
phrases identified with the Gramotron PCFG are annotated as <np> and
<pp> elements:

<s> 
  ... 
  <pp h="[head (preposition)]" len="[no. of words]">
  ...
  <np h="[head noun]" len="[no. of words]">
  ...
  </np>
  </pp>

</s>

Embedded NPs and PPs are represented up to a depth of two nested
phrases (more deeply embedded phrases were dropped). For access with
CQP, the nested elements are renamed to <np1>/<pp1> or <np2>/<pp2>,
depending on the level of embedding.
